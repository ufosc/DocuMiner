Jeffrey Edward Epstein (/ˈɛpstiːn/ EP-steen;[2] January 20, 1953 – August 10, 2019) was an American financier and convicted sex offender.[3][4] Epstein, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, began his professional life by teaching at a private school in Manhattan despite lacking a college degree. After his dismissal from the school he entered the banking and finance sector, working at Bear Stearns in various roles; he eventually started his own firm. Epstein developed an elite social circle and procured many women and children; he and some of his associates then sexually abused them.[5][4][6][7]

In 2005, police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein after a parent complained that he had sexually abused her 14-year-old daughter.[8] Epstein pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 by a Florida state court of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute.[5][9] He served almost 13 months in custody, but with extensive work release. He was convicted of only these two crimes as part of a controversial plea deal; federal officials had identified 36 girls, some as young as 14 years old, whom Epstein had allegedly sexually abused.[1][10]

Epstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York.[11][12] He died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019.[13] The medical examiner ruled the death a suicide.[14] Epstein's lawyers have disputed the ruling, and there has been significant public skepticism about the true cause of his death.[15][16] Since his death precluded the possibility of pursuing criminal charges, a judge dismissed all criminal charges on August 29, 2019.[17][18] Epstein had a decades-long association with Ghislaine Maxwell, who faces persistent allegations of procuring and sexually trafficking underage girls for Epstein, which led to her arrest by the FBI on July 2, 2020.[19][20][21] Epstein also maintained long-term relationships with various high-profile individuals, including Donald Trump, Leslie Wexner[22] and Prince Andrew, Duke of York.[23]
